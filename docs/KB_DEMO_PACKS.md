# Demo KB Packs

`data/kb/` is demo seed content, not the primary operational source of truth.

## Operational model

- operational corpus: PostgreSQL
- demo seed corpus: `data/kb/`
- workspace files: `data/workspaces/`
- runtime session/job state: `data/runtime/`

The next-runtime cutover did not change the KB storage model. It changed how live AGENT
turns execute around that data.

## When to use `data/kb`

Use the bundled demo KB when you want:

- local demos
- regression scenarios
- starter content for UI testing

Do not assume those files are already indexed in PostgreSQL until you explicitly sync them.

## Common commands

```bash
python run.py sync-kb
python run.py init-kb
```

Automatic startup seeding is still supported:

```env
SEED_DEMO_KB_ON_STARTUP=true
```

## Key distinction

The demo KB is still content.

The current runtime durability features such as transcripts, jobs, and notifications live
under `data/runtime/*`, not under `data/kb/`.
