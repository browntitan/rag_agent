# Agent Harness Audit

This audit compares the live `agentic_chatbot_next` runtime against the external guidance
reviewed in the uploaded analysis pack:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CODE_FLOW.md`
- `BEST_PRACTICES.md`

The guidance is treated as advisory input for a general-purpose multi-task agent, not as a
strict blueprint for a coding-only agent.

## Adopt now

### 1. Remove the old runtime surface and stale compatibility layer

Why it matters:

- the repository had two competing runtime stories
- old import paths made the live architecture harder to understand
- docs stayed stale longer because the deprecated path was still present

Decision:

- adopt now

Status in this pass:

- remove the old `agentic_chatbot.runtime` package
- remove the old `ChatbotApp` compatibility surface
- migrate in-repo tests and imports onto next-runtime contracts

### 2. Make initial-agent selection more data-driven before expanding the agent set

Observed live behavior:

- router hints are hard-coded to a small set in `router.py` and `llm_router.py`
- `choose_agent_name(...)` in `router/policy.py` is now registry-aware through
  `build_router_targets(registry)`, but the live deterministic hint generation still centers
  on `coordinator`, `data_analyst`, and `rag_worker`

Why it matters:

- this is fine for the current `general` / `coordinator` / `data_analyst` / `rag_worker` shape
- it will become brittle once the system grows into a broader general-purpose agent with more
  top-level specialists

Decision:

- adopt next in implementation, but do not force the refactor in this pass

Recommended follow-up:

- move more of the deterministic hint generation into registry-aware or config-aware policy
  instead of relying on a small hard-coded top-level specialist set

### 3. Enrich tool policy before adding broader world-changing tools

Observed live behavior:

- the repo already has a centralized `ToolPolicyService`
- current policy mainly covers allowed tools, read-only gating, workspace requirements, and
  background-job safety

Why it matters:

- this is acceptable for the current bounded tool surface
- it is thinner than the richer permission and metadata model described in the external guidance

Decision:

- adopt next when the tool surface grows beyond document, memory, orchestration, and data-analysis
  tools

Recommended follow-up:

- add stronger approval and safety semantics before introducing more open-ended external-action tools

## Docs only

### 1. Query-loop ownership was overstated

Observed live behavior:

- `RuntimeService` owns routing and ingest
- `RuntimeKernel` owns persistence, jobs, notifications, and orchestration
- `QueryLoop` dispatches by agent mode and injects skill/memory context
- `general_agent.py` owns the actual `react` execution loop, using LangGraph ReAct or a
  plan-execute fallback

Decision:

- docs only

Action in this pass:

- update architecture and control-flow docs to describe `QueryLoop` as the dispatcher and
  `general_agent.py` as the live `react` executor

### 2. Router docs missed `rag_worker`

Observed live behavior:

- the live router can suggest `rag_worker`
- the router docs only listed `coordinator`, `data_analyst`, and empty string

Decision:

- docs only

Action in this pass:

- update router docs to include `rag_worker`

### 3. Gateway and runtime docs still described removed compatibility paths

Observed live behavior:

- several docs still referenced the removed compatibility wrapper and old runtime as active repo
  context

Decision:

- docs only

Action in this pass:

- update README and runtime docs to describe the repo as next-runtime-only

## Keep as-is

### 1. Keep the simpler next-runtime tool contract

Observed divergence:

- the external coding-agent guidance assumes a richer tool object with broader UI and policy
  metadata
- the live repo uses a simpler `ToolDefinition` plus centralized policy service

Why this is acceptable:

- the live tool plane is smaller and more internal
- the current abstraction already cleanly separates tool metadata, policy, and binding
- a heavier tool object is not required yet for this product

### 2. Keep tools and skills as separate abstractions

Observed live behavior:

- tools are bound runtime capabilities under `src/agentic_chatbot_next/tools/`
- skills are retrieved prompt context under `src/agentic_chatbot_next/skills/`

Why this is good:

- it matches the external guidance closely
- it keeps operating guidance separate from side-effecting actions

### 3. Keep file-backed memory, jobs, notifications, and verifier-style orchestration

Observed live behavior:

- early persistence is in place
- worker jobs, mailboxes, notifications, and event logs are durable
- memory is file-backed
- coordinator mode already separates planning, execution, finalization, and verification

Why this is good:

- these are strong patterns for a general-purpose agent, not only for a coding agent
- they directly improve debuggability, resumability, and context control

### 4. Keep the narrower extension story for now

Observed divergence:

- the external reference includes a larger MCP/plugin/deferred-tool extension plane
- the live next runtime currently relies on Python-defined tools, markdown agents, and retrieved
  skill packs

Why this is acceptable:

- the current product does not yet need that much extension machinery
- adding it prematurely would increase complexity faster than it improves robustness

Recommended trigger to revisit:

- revisit only when the product needs third-party capability injection, dynamic tool discovery,
  or a much broader specialist-agent catalog

## Bottom line

The live next runtime already matches the external guidance in the areas that matter most for a
general-purpose agent:

- a persistent session kernel
- explicit routing
- durable worker jobs
- file-backed memory
- separate tools and skills
- verification-aware orchestration

The biggest issues were repository clarity and doc drift, not a fundamentally wrong live
architecture. The main architectural follow-ups are to make initial-agent selection less
hard-coded and to deepen the permission model only when the tool surface expands.
